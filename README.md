============

A demo starting point for an AngularJS SharePoint application.  This project relies heavily on Marc Anderson's SPServices to bridge the gap between AngularJS and SharePoint.  I'm still working on adding some demo modules so please check back in a bit to really see what we can do.

## Usage

Add the contents of the /dist folder to a document library or folder in your SharePoint instance and open the index.html.


## Project Background

This project was created out of the necesity to develop custom solutions on very large SharePoint instances where deployable solutions aren't an option.  We're able to bypass many of the restrictions in our environment by running all code on the client.  This both lessons the load on the server and provides a better experience for the end user.
